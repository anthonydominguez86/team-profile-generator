# The Assignment: Team Profile Generator

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

* WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information

* THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

* WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML

* THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

* WHEN I click on the GitHub username

* THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

* WHEN I start the application

* THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

* WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

* THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

* WHEN I select the engineer option

* THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

* WHEN I select the intern option

* THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

* WHEN I decide to finish building my team

* THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

This assignment was very challenging it took not only the aspects of writing a backend application that would create a file but the biggest challenge was creating the tests for the application. The assignment was very detailed because it took multiple parameters and multiple constructors to take the input and create the HTML file. This part was challenging but based on the last assignment quite manageable since the last assignment created a file using inquirer. As stated above we had to take user input in a parent class for every employee and add different parameters (questions) for each employees title that differed from the initial employee questions. 

# Lessons:

I took a lot from this because it not only encompassed something I already had some experience with based on the previous project but it had a lot of extras. Building constructors to add the parent class constructor linking those all together to make an application that would create a file encompassing those parameters defined above. Taking that code and building a test for it to make sure it was valid code built well and would run the application. There was so many more lessons even to testing the code I had an issue where the test was not defined in the package.json so it would not even run the test this was another hurdle i had to research and overcome but it was a great learning experience and taught me a lot about the full stack web development.  

# Takeaways: 

For this it was what I had mentioned above the biggest takeaway is the full stack development and how that works to develop an application from the backend and see it on the frontend is just amazing to me. It starts with files and grows to something that can be seen in the browser and interacted with in the terminal. The tests of this assignment was also a big takeaway and probably the most challenging part of this assignment since they were a part of the cohort that we have had little experience with writing or testing. I don't completely fully understand them or understand their necessity but with further experience using them I'm sure it will become much more clear.
